# Changelog

All notable changes to ytcui will be documented in this file.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Thumbnails now actually render.** chafa emits ANSI escape sequences that
  ncurses `printw()` cannot handle — they were rendering as raw garbage or
  invisible. Fixed by recording the thumbnail region during the draw pass and
  calling `render_at()` **after** `ncurses refresh()`, writing chafa output
  directly to stdout via ANSI cursor positioning (`\033[row;colH`). Completely
  bypasses ncurses for thumbnail I/O.
- **Thumbnail download fallback.** If the primary URL returns a tiny/invalid
  response (common with ytcui-dl API thumbnail URLs on older videos), the
  downloader now retries with `hqdefault.jpg` automatically.
- **chafa format auto-detection.** Detects kitty → sixel → symbols+truecolor
  → symbols+256 based on `$TERM`, `$COLORTERM`, `$KITTY_WINDOW_ID`.
- **`thumbs_available` now logs clearly** when chafa is missing rather than
  silently setting itself to false and showing nothing.
- chafa is now a required dependency. The install script installs it as a
  required package (not optional) on all supported package managers.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-23

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### macOS: Terminal freeze when closing mpv window via GUI

- **FIXED: TUI becomes completely unresponsive after closing mpv video window**
  - Root cause: The complex `compat.h` watchdog/death-pipe process management
    introduced in 2.5.0 for cross-platform parent death detection was interfering
    with terminal state on macOS. When mpv's Cocoa window was closed, the forked
    watchdog process and pipe handling corrupted the terminal, causing ncurses
    `getch()` to block forever.
  - Fix: Completely rewrote `player.cpp` to use simple process management:
    - Removed all `compat.h` dependency from player
    - Removed death pipes and watchdog process forking
    - Removed complex sync pipe handshaking for setpgid()
    - Now uses simple `fork()` + `setpgid(0,0)` + `usleep(10ms)`
    - Linux still gets `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)` via direct `#ifdef`
    - macOS/BSD just rely on process group kill for cleanup
  - Kept all the good 2.6.x features: stream URL pre-resolution for fast video
    start, volume control, hardware accel toggle, cache options.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-03-11

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### macOS Compatibility (10.x and up — all versions)

- **FIXED: `EVFILT_PROC` / `NOTE_EXIT` permission failure on macOS < 11 (Big Sur)**
  - Root cause: kqueue watching a grandparent PID from a grandchild process silently fails
    with `EPERM` on macOS 10.x (Catalina and below). macOS 11 relaxed this same-UID rule.
  - Fix: Removed kqueue `EVFILT_PROC` watchdog on macOS entirely. Now uses the
    pipe-based watchdog (already used for generic BSDs) for **all** macOS versions.
    The pipe approach requires zero OS permissions and is reliable on macOS 10.x+.
  - Added `macos_major_version()` via `sysctlbyname("kern.osproductversion")` for
    runtime version detection used in `--diag` output.

- **FIXED: URL copy silently failing on all macOS versions**
  - Root cause: `wl-copy` (Wayland) and `xclip` (X11) were being called on macOS where
    neither exists. The copy action appeared to succeed but nothing was written.
  - Fix: macOS now uses `pbcopy` (available since macOS 10.3). Linux/BSD still use
    `wl-copy` → `xclip` → `xsel` fallback chain.
  - Also switched from `echo -n` (shell-dependent) to `printf '%s'` (POSIX portable).

- **FIXED: "Open in browser" silently failing on all macOS versions**
  - Root cause: `open_in_browser()` in `app.cpp` unconditionally called `xdg-open`
    which does not exist on macOS. The `play_xdg()` function in `player.cpp` had the
    correct `#if defined(YTUI_MACOS)` guard but `open_in_browser()` did not.
  - Fix: Added proper platform guard — `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux/BSD.

- **FIXED: `setpgid()` race condition causing intermittent playback failures**
  - Root cause: After `fork()`, parent waited for child's `setpgid(0,0)` using
    `usleep(10000)` — a 10ms timing gamble. On slower macOS (pre-11), scheduling
    variance meant `kill(-pgid, ...)` fired before the new process group existed,
    sending signals to the wrong group or failing silently.
  - Fix: Replaced with a sync pipe. Child writes 1 byte after `setpgid()` completes.
    Parent polls up to 500ms (1ms steps with `WNOHANG` child-death checks).
    Fully deterministic, zero race. Applied to `play_piped`, `play_direct`, `play_xdg`.

### ✨ New Features

#### `--diag` — Full system diagnostic
- New flag that exits immediately (no TUI) and prints a comprehensive diagnostic:
  - Platform and compat layer details (pdeathsig strategy, pipe2 emulation, watchdog type)
  - macOS version with explicit warning if < 11
  - All binary dependencies with version strings (yt-dlp, mpv, curl, chafa, clipboard tools)
  - Config and log file paths with existence checks
  - Contents of `config.json` if present
  - Live yt-dlp search test (`ytsearch1:test`)
  - mpv `--version` output
  - Clipboard tool availability check with warning if none found
  - `pipe_cloexec()` self-test
  - Pipe watchdog fork test (macOS)
  - Last 20 lines of `debug.log`
- Run this first when anything is broken: `ytcui --diag`

#### `--injectconfig` — Write config from CLI
- Write any config key directly from the command line without editing JSON or opening TUI
- Supports: `max_results`, `theme`, `grayscale`, `sort_by`, `filter_type`, `filter_dur`,
  `ytdlp_path`, `mpv_path`
- Examples:
  ```
  ytcui --injectconfig max_results=25
  ytcui --injectconfig theme=dracula
  ytcui --injectconfig max_results=20 theme=nord grayscale=false
  ```

#### `--debug` / `--logdump` improvements
- Debug log now includes compat platform dump and macOS version on startup
- Dependency check errors now suggest `--diag` for deeper investigation

### 🔧 Internal Changes

- `compat.h`: Added `dump_platform_info()` used by `--diag`
- `app.h`: Added `copy_to_clipboard()` declaration (split from `execute_action`)
- Error messages on missing `yt-dlp`/`mpv` now suggest `ytcui --diag`

## [2.5.0] - 2025-02-27

### 🎨 New Features

#### Cross-Platform Support
- **macOS support**: Full native support for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **FreeBSD support**: Native support using `procctl(PROC_PDEATHSIG_CTL)`
- **BSD support**: Generic BSD support with watchdog-based process management

### 🔧 Major Improvements

#### Process Management Overhaul
- **New `compat.h` abstraction layer**: Unified cross-platform process management
- **Platform-specific parent death detection**:
  - Linux: `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)` — kernel signals on parent death
  - FreeBSD: `procctl(P_PID, 0, PROC_PDEATHSIG_CTL, &sig)` — same concept
  - macOS: `kqueue` with `EVFILT_PROC` + `NOTE_EXIT` — watches parent PID
  - Generic BSD: Pipe-based watchdog — detects EOF when parent dies
- **Watchdog process**: Forks a lightweight watchdog in same process group that kills all children when parent dies (macOS/generic BSD)
- **Portable `pipe_cloexec()`**: Replaces Linux-only `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC)` with portable `pipe()` + `fcntl(FD_CLOEXEC)` on macOS

#### Installer Improvements
- **macOS Homebrew support**: Automatically installs Homebrew if missing, then uses it for dependencies
- **Xcode CLT detection**: Prompts for Xcode Command Line Tools installation on macOS
- **FreeBSD pkg support**: Uses native `pkg` package manager
- **Improved OS detection**: Detects Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly

#### Build System
- **Cross-platform Makefile**: Detects OS and selects appropriate compiler/flags
- **Homebrew ncurses handling**: Properly finds Homebrew's keg-only ncurses on macOS
- **Compiler selection**: Uses `clang++` on macOS/FreeBSD, `g++` on Linux (configurable)
- **Platform defines**: Sets `YTUI_LINUX`, `YTUI_MACOS`, or `YTUI_FREEBSD` at compile time

#### Update Script
- **macOS-compatible `mktemp`**: Uses portable temp directory creation
- **Homebrew PATH setup**: Exports proper environment for builds on macOS
- **`gmake` detection**: Uses GNU make on FreeBSD when available

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Removed direct `#include <sys/prctl.h>` from `player.h` (now in `compat.h`)
- Process group management refactored (internal, no user-facing changes)

### 📝 Technical Notes

#### How Parent Death Detection Works

**Linux/FreeBSD (native):**
```
fork() → child calls set_pdeathsig(SIGKILL) → kernel sends SIGKILL when parent dies
```

**macOS (kqueue watchdog):**
```
fork() → child forks watchdog → watchdog monitors parent via kqueue(EVFILT_PROC)
       → parent dies → kqueue returns → watchdog calls kill(0, SIGTERM) on process group
```

**Generic BSD (pipe watchdog):**
```
parent creates pipe → fork() → child forks watchdog holding read end
→ parent holds write end (auto-closes on death)
→ watchdog blocks on read() → EOF when parent dies → kills process group
```

## [2.0.0] - 2025-02-18

### 🎨 New Features

#### Theme System
- Added 8 color themes: `default`, `grayscale`, `nord`, `dracula`, `solarized`, `monokai`, `gruvbox`, `tokyo`
- Themes can be set via CLI (`-t dracula`) or config file
- `--grayscale` still works for backwards compatibility

#### Auto-Update System
- **Auto-check on startup**: ytcui checks GitHub for new versions (2s timeout, won't slow startup)
- **`--upgrade` flag**: Run `ytcui --upgrade` to update to the latest version
- **Self-updating**: Update script is installed to `/usr/local/share/ytcui/` and updates itself
- **`--no-update-check`**: Skip the startup version check if desired
- Update script and VERSION file persist even if you delete the repo folder

#### Enhanced CLI
- Beautiful colored `--help` output
- `--version` / `-v` flag
- `--theme` / `-t` flag for theme selection
- `--debug` / `-d` for debug logging
- `--logdump` for full mpv/yt-dlp output capture
- `--upgrade` for easy updates
- `--no-update-check` to skip version checking

### 🔧 Stability Improvements
